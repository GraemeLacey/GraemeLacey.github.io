<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against scams, vandalism, and theft. Tip: Frequently keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. We need to once again react to the alarm; each reaction is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one way of eliminating expensive false alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a particular level, you can make it instantly turn off the heating systems.
