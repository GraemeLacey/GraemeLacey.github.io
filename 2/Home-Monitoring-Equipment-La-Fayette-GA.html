<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus fraud, vandalism, and theft. Recommendation: Often keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. We need to once again react to the alarm; each reaction is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one way of removing expensive incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a certain level, you can make it instantly switch off the heating systems. You can immediately make the wise lights turn on to scare away potential intruders if the motion sensing units are activated.</p>
