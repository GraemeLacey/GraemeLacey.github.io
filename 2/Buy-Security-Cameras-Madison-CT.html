<p>The security systems I have actually created and implemented are strictly for monitoring activity of a potential target, whether from a terrorist threat or community thieves or vandals. The systems are deployed for the protection of lives and home and not to see individuals as they jaywalk throughout the street or run a red light (which both are, by the way, versus the law). Those are different services with various requirements and objectives.</p>
<p>The Ring Bridge is the company's clever light center, which can support as much as 50 wise lights at once, allowing you to sync up the systems' clever lights with one another, as well as with cameras and video doorbells. Basically, if one gadget connected to the Ring Bridge is activated, other linked devices will activate too. A stand-alone motion sensor and the Ring Transformer are extra devices that interact with the Ring Bridge to boost the systems' wise light abilities.</p>

<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 delivers free benefits like individual detection, familiar-face notifies, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage begins at $5 monthly.) However, in our tests the familiar-face alerts worked just about half of the time and the camera routinely detached from the network multiple times a day (when everything else on our network appeared fine).
