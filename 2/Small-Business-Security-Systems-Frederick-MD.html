<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against scams, vandalism, and theft. Suggestion: Often keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we should once again react to the alarm; each reaction is billed.

IP cameras that are connected to the same network, usually by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR.
