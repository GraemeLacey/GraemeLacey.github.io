No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
