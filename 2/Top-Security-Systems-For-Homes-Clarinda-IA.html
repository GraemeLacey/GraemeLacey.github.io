Incorrect alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the authorities if they take place often enough. Another prospective disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool must be changed or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is normally balanced out by the truth that there are no installation expenses.</p>
<p>Blue by ADT security systems begin around $200 for equipment. You can pick from a predetermined equipment package or curate your own setup to match your security needs.

At $36.99, ADT is one of the more expensive choices for landline monitoring.</p>

When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
