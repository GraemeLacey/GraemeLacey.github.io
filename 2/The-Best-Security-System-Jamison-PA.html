SimpliSafe reacted with a statement saying the system would signal users when it found any type of disturbance. The company likewise questioned the video, claiming that there would require to be an ideal storm of situations for somebody to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors situated 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to replicate the concern.
