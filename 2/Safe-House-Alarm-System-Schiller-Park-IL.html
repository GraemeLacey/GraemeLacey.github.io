<p>It would be easy to roll your eyes at this last point, however it implies you can ask your home security camera for the weather report - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the system will respond.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
