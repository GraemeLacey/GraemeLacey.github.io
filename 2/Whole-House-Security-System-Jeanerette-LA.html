<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft.

Moreover, there is occasionally as much as an hour hold-up in getting alerts on your phone from the Nest Guard, a worrying problem.

A security camera with motion alerts may be the best fit if you're concerned about burglaries or keeping deliveries safe.</p>

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large quantity of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, however not suitable with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for additional circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less circuitry in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera individually, generally via 110VAC power.</p>
