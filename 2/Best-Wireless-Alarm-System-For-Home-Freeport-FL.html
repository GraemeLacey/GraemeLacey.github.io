Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.

But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically sophisticated outdoor camera we've evaluated. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision.

It can distinguish between general motion and individuals, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even identify individuals you've identified (after a knowing duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
