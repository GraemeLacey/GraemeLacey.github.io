Google Nest is not understood for being cheap. The Nest Secure system will set you back around $400 for a starter package.

Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have an agreement, and its equipment pricing is very reasonable, so it's not a total splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically sophisticated outdoor camera we've evaluated. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high dynamic variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between general motion and individuals, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even identify individuals you've identified (after a knowing duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>

<p>A wireless doorbell camera can work as a stand-alone gadget or in tandem with the rest of your security system. When somebody sounds the doorbell, it triggers the doorbell camera.

AHD cameras use the very same RG59 or RG6 cable as traditional CCTV cameras. CAT-5 cable with video baluns can likewise be used. While pro monitoring costs more, it's more secure. When something activates your alarm, your monitoring company will get the alert and after that alert the authorities for you. Seems like a more secure bet to us.</p>
