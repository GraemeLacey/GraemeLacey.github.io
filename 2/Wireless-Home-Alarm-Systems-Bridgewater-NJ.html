<p>While every house owner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their generally high costs, complex agreements with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in incorrect alarms. ELERTS is a complimentary smart device app that allows people who see something suspicious to take a photo and rapidly send it to public safety officials. For instance, a public transit rider might observe someone behaving suspiciously. Many people are fiddling, surfing or texting with their mobile devices.

With traditional CCTV security cameras, the video signal is processed and transferred in analog format for local viewing from one central monitoring area.
