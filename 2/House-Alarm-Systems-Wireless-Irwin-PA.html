<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk to an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera close to the NVR is absolutely something to be thought about. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of an issue however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would trigger an interruption in the signal.

<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
