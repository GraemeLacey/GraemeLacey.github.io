The one time where lag does end up being a little an issue is between spotting and tape-recording motion.

If a nefarious criminal was fast enough, they might surpass the camera prior to it had time to record them.

For more innovative home security and wise home functions, Vivint would be a terrific option. However, if you wish to self-install your security system, we would recommend Frontpoint, SimpliSafe or Protect America. The provider you choose must satisfy your security needs.</p>
