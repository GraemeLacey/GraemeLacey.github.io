Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first question you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a number of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you plan to save and the length of time you prepare to keep documented video. The video is going to consume up storage area quickly if there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution.

This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image throughout a far larger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
