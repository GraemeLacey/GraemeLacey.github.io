<h3>Home Security System Cameras in California</h3>
<p>We do not advise the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complex than it needs to be. Recordings, alerts, and combination all require different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we frequently found action missing out on, thanks to irregular and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

These are very well developed and reputable. Transferring your Overall Link cameras is as basic as changing outlets-- you can move them quickly whenever your security requires change.
