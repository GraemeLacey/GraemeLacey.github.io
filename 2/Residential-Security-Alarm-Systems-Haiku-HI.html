<p>Nurse calling systems usually include emergency buttons or pull strings within the patient's washroom. If a patient is having trouble, he can push the button or pull the string and it will send an alert to the nurse station. This is an easy switch that is normally open or usually closed. The majority of your commercial security cameras consist of dry contact input ports to integrate alarms and signals, sensing units, gain access to control, and so on.
