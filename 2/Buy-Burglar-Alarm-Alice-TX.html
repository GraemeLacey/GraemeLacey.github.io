Here's how it plays out: First you have to download the app and put in your email address. Then you get in the WiFi information of the network you're trying to connect to. Then the phone plays a shrill, electronic sound wave to the camera to send the WiFi info. (You need to play this at complete volume or it will not work). Windows smash, pets shout, cats squeal, children sob. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first ten seconds. It does not work. And it never works.</p>
<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is top quality, if not particularly revolutionary, so we're actually recommending the security cameras here.

These types of cameras usually utilize rechargeable batteries that can be quickly popped out and taken inside your home for charging with a USB cable, but they tend to drain pipes rapidly in chillier weather.
