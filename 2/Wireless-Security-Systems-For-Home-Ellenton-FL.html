The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
