<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular since the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers understand that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
