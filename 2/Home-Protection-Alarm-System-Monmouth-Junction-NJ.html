Rather, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals whenever you walk by.

<p>Another important topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand how much is enough.
