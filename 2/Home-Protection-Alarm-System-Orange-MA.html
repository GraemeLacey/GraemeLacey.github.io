Naturally, you may wish to think about acquiring a security camera or 2 to accompany your system, however opting for the five-piece Ring Alarm set plus a Video Doorbell 2 (around $400 overall) is a little more expensive than Frontpoint's most basic bundle for $320 (or $255 with the 20% promotional deal), which doesn't consist of a camera.</p>
