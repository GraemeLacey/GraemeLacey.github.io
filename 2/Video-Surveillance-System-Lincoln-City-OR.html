Your nvr and cameras connect by means of a network switch or router. You can easily access video on an NVR through a web internet browser or mobile app.</p>
<p>Unlike many other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies every time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
