Woot has actually also published good deals on wireless security systems in the past. It's a bit harder to prepare your purchase when shopping at Woot, as most of the offers are only offered for 24-hours. Because of that, I advise that you bookmark the electronics tab and inspect back frequently. In addition, DIY home security systems without police assistance are not eligible for those desired home insurance coverage discounts.</p>

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never ever matches the manufacturer's statistics because this comes from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest offender for brief battery life without a doubt.
