<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal since the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
