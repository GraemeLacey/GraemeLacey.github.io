<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely normal given that the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody going into the store.
