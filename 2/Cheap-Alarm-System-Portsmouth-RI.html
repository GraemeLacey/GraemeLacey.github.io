However, individuals need to take into consideration the frequency and duration of their absences from home or business - instead of just their tenancy. Who is home, when they are not?

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely regular since the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level.

HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as consumers recognize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
