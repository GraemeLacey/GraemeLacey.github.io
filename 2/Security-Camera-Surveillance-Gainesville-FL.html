<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and frequently over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for further circuitry.

A local system does not have the capacity to couple with other clever devices and can not be managed from another location. Also a local alarm won't contact the authorities; it simply triggers an audible siren to alert individuals close by.</p>
