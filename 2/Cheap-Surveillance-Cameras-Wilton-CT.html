Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies every time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
