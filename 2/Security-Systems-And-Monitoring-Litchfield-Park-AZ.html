But neither can tape-record constantly, and they both need the Ring Protect strategy to capture recordings. Also, the wired version typically left gaps of up to 7 seconds in between 1-minute recordings, while the battery variation left about a minute in between 30-second clips. Both also lack individual detection and geofencing, which other cameras use to minimize false signals.</p>

However, while 4K resolution uses some advantages, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are large and use up a great deal of taping storage area. A lot, in reality, that they require about four times the hard drive space of 1080p to record the very same length of video footage.
