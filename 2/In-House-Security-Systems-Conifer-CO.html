As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely regular considering that the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
