The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Need to be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
