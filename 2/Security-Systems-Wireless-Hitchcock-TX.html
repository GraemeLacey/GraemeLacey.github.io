If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be split. Using an enough time random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly picked words) makes pre-shared essential WPA virtually uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based on the last IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
