The typical reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, providing a chance for the harmful assaulter to tape these codes and use different breaking tools to evaluate security weak points and exploit them to acquire unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can introduce a dictionary design attack of "possibly accepted" security keys based on the "model" security essential captured during the network recovery.</p>
