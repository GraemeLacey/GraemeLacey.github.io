Box cameras present an obvious indication for anyone who passes by that they are being tape-recorded on CCTV and this can be a great deterrent of theft and crime. Whereas dome cameras are smaller sized and more discreet. These compact cameras are ideal for monitoring a bigger area such as your front or back garden and can follow movement with ease.</p>
