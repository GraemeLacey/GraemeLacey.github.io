<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security specialists researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for among our top spots. Nevertheless, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can tape approximately 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, but entries were often missing, in spite of showing up in the app's activity timeline.
