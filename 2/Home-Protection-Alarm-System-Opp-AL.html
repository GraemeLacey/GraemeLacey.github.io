That being said, bullet cameras are more vulnerable to vandalism due to the fact that of their apparent appearance. Additionally, the shape of the camera is ideal for focusing on a fixed field, such as an entry or exit, but requires multiple cameras if a user needs to see numerous fixed views. Bullet cameras are easily mountable and can work inside or outdoors. They include a small lip on the end of the camera that adds weather protection and reduces glare.</p>
