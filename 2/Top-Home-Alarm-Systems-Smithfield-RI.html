<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a brief description of how thermal cameras work: All items produce infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy given off by an object is referred to as its heat signature. In general, the hotter a things is, the more radiation it produces. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensing unit that is capable of spotting tiny distinctions in temperature level. The device collects the infrared radiation from things in the scene and develops an electronic image based upon details about the temperature distinctions. Since items are hardly ever exactly the same temperature level as other things around them, a thermal camera can spot them, and they will appear as unique in a thermal image.</p>

<p>We required guards for our yearly Coats for the Cold event to protect the line tent and building, keep order in the wee hours of the morning and to start the heating system at 5am. The first guard arrived early so he could look at the whole area and talk to me about my issues. He was expert, extremely comforting and polite. The second guard arrived in the middle of the night and took over. When I showed up in the early morning to get the occasion started, he was likewise expert, encouraging and considerate.
