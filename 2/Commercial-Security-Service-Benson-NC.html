<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
