This lets operators focus on specific areas or track specific motions. The cameras can likewise run patterns or turn to a predetermined position.</p>
<p>While it strikes the resolution, we think there's a little interpolation on its 4K video given that the Arlo Ultra's recordings can tend to be a little smeary when zoomed right in, however this is still by far the sharpest security camera we have actually seen in action, wireless or otherwise.
