<p>Many security cameras can be utilized both inside and outdoors. They typically have the exact same functions like night vision or remote watching, however they differ in durability. Outdoor cameras should be weather resistant and sometimes, completely water resistant. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance score are the most long lasting. Bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor alternatives since their design allows for minimum glare. In terms of detection, it is better to have a camera equipped with infrared detection rather than motion detection. This will supply more precise and less frequent alerts because many times the motion detection is set off by motion such as a tree blowing or an animal running by.</p>
