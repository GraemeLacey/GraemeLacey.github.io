Instead, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs whenever you stroll by.
