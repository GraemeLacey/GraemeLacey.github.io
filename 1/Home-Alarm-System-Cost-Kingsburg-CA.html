<p>Twenty-five years ago, general and business communications were mostly simultaneous.

The same applies for security and video surveillance. Usually, CCTV is most efficient as an active system, with a security guard monitoring the corridors and another person, someplace, watching video surveillance displays for assistance. Whatever is synchronized and everything happens in genuine time.</p>
<p>A lot of contemporary CCTV video surveillance systems integrate DVRs (digital video recorders) which allow operators to reap some of the advantages of a network-based surveillance setup. DVRs transform the analog video footage to digital, which helps to extend storage capability, makes it a lot easier to browse archived footage, and likewise enables users to stream video over a network for remote watching from numerous places.

However keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being damaged or damaged by the more determined robbers. If trespassers can not see any security cameras, they might also be less mindful about covering their faces and their tracks.</p>
