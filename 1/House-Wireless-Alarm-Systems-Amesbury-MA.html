<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later on created to attend to the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Utilizing a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily picked words) makes pre-shared essential WPA essentially uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based upon the final IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those file encryption schemes, any customer in the network that knows the secrets can check out all the traffic.</p>
