<p>To gauge reaction times for the monitoring company, we set off each system a minimum of 5 times, utilizing contact and motion sensing units. Nevertheless, remember that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls must be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs confirmation from a private security guard. Several cities also require a license to even run a home and own security system.

<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, many alarm systems work the exact very same method. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. If the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits, which means. If someone were to unlock that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the alarm system. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical present to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>
