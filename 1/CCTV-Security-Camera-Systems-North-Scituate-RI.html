<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are relied on by more than 60,000 organisations, universities, and federal government centers, and residential clients. Ring's app provides a range of settings, such as customized motion zones, scheduling and more. Add to that Ring's neighborhood-watch function, which lets you see what's taking place in your area from other Ring users, along with from your local cops and fire departments.

<p>The first (and most obvious, for sure) part of a CCTV system are the security cameras. Which security cameras are ideal for your system depends on your individual needs and budget; are you placing them indoors or outdoors? Is 1080P a large adequate resolution? Will they have the ability to see and record video efficiently in low-lighting? Are they placed with appropriate field of view, or will a PTZ (Pan Tilt Zoom) camera be essential? These are very important questions to be considered when choosing security cameras for your CCTV system.</p>
