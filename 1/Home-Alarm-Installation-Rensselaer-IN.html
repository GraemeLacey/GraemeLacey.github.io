<p>Video recording isn't a standard choice on many security systems. House owners trying to find a system that offers video recording need to ensure the choice is available rather than assume it is. Storing video is likewise an issue. Video files are big, which implies a lot of space is required. There are a handful of companies that offer complimentary video storage, but the video is sent out to a cloud account and just kept for a few days. For longer access to video, expect to pay a month-to-month storage charge.</p>
