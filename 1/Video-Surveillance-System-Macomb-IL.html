<p>Our SSA security system was set up at our new home on Friday, June 23rd. Ron Thompson was our sales specialist. He offered the recommendations regarding what was needed for our home and was on-site for the installation. Darek got here and dealt with the installation right on time.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>

<p>You can use a wireless connection to operate your SimpliSafe system, however it does not support Z-Wave, Zigbee, or IFTTT, indicating you won't have the ability to connect it straight to other third-party devices like smart locks or automate certain actions in the home. You can, however, utilize Alexa to equip or deactivate the SimpliSafe system and connect it to your Nest Thermostat to conserve energy based on when you're home or away. However these integrations aren't quite as robust as the home or Ring systems.</p>
<p>Although 1080p is normally the standard resolution for cameras we've checked, there are benefits to models with higher-resolution sensing units. Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but practically all have digital zoom, which crop and enlarge whatever the camera is tape-recording. The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still be able to see things plainly.</p>
