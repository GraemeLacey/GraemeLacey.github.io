The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
