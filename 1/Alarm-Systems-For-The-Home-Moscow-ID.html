<p>The loudest of the smart alarm we tested, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good task at alerting anybody in your house and those nearby that there's an issue. During testing, the siren fasted to sound when any of the sensors were activated and we enjoy that the level of sensitivity of the motion sensor can be adjusted to account for family pets, too. The alarm system is simply one of two we checked that includes an external siren, and we're pleased that it also features a dummy siren that can be attached to another external wall, even more preventing anyone from trying to break in to your property.
