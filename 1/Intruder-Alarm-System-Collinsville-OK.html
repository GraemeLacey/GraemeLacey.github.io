This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
