The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
