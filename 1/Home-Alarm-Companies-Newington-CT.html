Outdoor cameras must be weather resistant and in many cases, entirely waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance ranking are the most resilient. Because their design allows for minimum glare, bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor options. In terms of detection, it is much better to have actually a camera equipped with infrared detection instead of motion detection.

Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
