<p>Pelco provides video surveillance cameras and video management solutions for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping centers, others, and hotels. IP cameras work by using an IP (IP means web protocol) network, often the exact same data network the rest of a company uses. If bandwidth is an issue, a different network utilizing category 5 wiring can be used. Either way, video information is recorded on a server, which implies video information can be found on website or in a remote area. After screening, we sent out each of our top picks, in addition to the Wyze Web cam v2, to Bill McKinley, head of details security at The New york city Times (Wirecutter's moms and dad company), for hack screening.
