Beyond those limitations, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

Variety extenders are used for bigger homes because many base stations usually just have a range of a couple hundred feet. Night vision.
