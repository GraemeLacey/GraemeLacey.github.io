<h3>Smart Home Security Monitoring in Illinois</h3>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
