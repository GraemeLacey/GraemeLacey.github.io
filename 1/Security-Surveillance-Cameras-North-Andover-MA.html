The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
