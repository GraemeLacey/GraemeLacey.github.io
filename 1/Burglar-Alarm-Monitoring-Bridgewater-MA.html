<p>Discover how to develop, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase staff member safety and minimize criminal offense. The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with dreadful night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are validating with Arlo whether our unit was defective, therefore we might revisit this review. Basically, the Nest camera sits anywhere you put it and records what it sees, conserving the last 5 days of video to the cloud. The broad face of the camera offers you an excellent visual field, and the photo you get is of good quality (you can alter the resolution; the much better it gets, the more data you'll use to save it to the cloud.) To see that footage, you can use an app on your phone or a browser link on your computer.</p>

A few minutes into the Do It Yourself installation, our tester got stuck getting her control panel up and online-- it just wouldn't connect. A help window appeared with a number to call, and a Frontpoint representative helped her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he might tell there was an issue with the circuit board. Definitely not perfect-- but the representative apologized and delivered her replacement control panel over night.</p>
