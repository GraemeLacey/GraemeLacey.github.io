<p>CCTV cameras are placed in locations where they are thought to be most effective, which usually includes highly inhabited towns, town hall, parking area, or numerous other high-crime areas (Welsh and Farrington 2008).

<p>Motion sensing units provide backup protection in case a burglar manages to get into your home. But they just operate when you run out the house. When you're sleeping, don't believe they'll secure you if someone enters! Quite the opposite, your alarm actually ignores motion sensing unit signals if you arm the system but stay at home. If the system worked any other way, it would false alarm whenever you strolled into a safeguarded room.</p>

<h3>Local Home Security Monitoring in New Jersey</h3>

Imagine what somebody like that might do with a citywide spy-camera system.</p>

Although burglary stays one of the most regularly reported criminal offenses, the clearance rate for U.S. burglaries has remained below 15 percent for many years. 14 Plainly, whatever contribution burglar alarms are making to fixing robbery cases is modest, at best. Some clever alarms consist of or can be used with wifi security cameras from the same maker.
