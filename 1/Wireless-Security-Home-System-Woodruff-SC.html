<p>Unlike many other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs each time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
