<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a destructive enemy, because the interruption of the network prevents the flow of data and in fact indirectly secures information by preventing it from being transmitted. The typical factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, supplying an opportunity for the malicious assailant to tape these codes and use numerous breaking tools to analyze security weak points and exploit them to acquire unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can launch a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security secrets based on the "model" security key recorded throughout the network recovery.</p>
