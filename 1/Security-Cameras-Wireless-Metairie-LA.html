<p>The Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is one of the most costly home security cameras around, however it's also one of the most intelligent, too. This weatherproof home security camera has a tamper-resistant style, a triple microphone variety and HDR support for better-quality videos than what other cameras produce.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.
