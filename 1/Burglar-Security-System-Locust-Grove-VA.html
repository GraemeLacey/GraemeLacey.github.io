<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not especially groundbreaking, so we're truly recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan option.

<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests possible wrongdoers are less likely to commit criminal activity if they think they are being enjoyed or have a higher threat of being apprehended. This is also known as the logical choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal offense avoidance method, which argues that chances to anger can be minimized by changing a range of systems such as increasing the threat of a wrongdoer being collared, increasing the effort to dedicate the crime, reducing rewards from criminal offense commission, and minimizing justifications that give rise to criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).

"As soon as the crime and offence figures were adapted to take account of the general downward pattern in criminal offenses and offences," criminologists discovered in one study, "reductions were noted in particular categories however there was no evidence to recommend that the cameras had actually decreased criminal offense overall in the city centre."
