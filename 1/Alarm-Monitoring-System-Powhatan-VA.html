When purchasing a system online, be aware that most of the time expert alarm companies will not install customer purchased products! Why? Alarm companies do not know if the purchased items are used, do not work, or have compatibility concerns.</p>
<p>Piza and coworkers (2019) carried out a new evaluation of the literature to update a meta-analysis by Welsh and Farrington (2008) that took a look at the effects of closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance on criminal activity prevention. The researchers looked for CCTV examinations published between 2007 and 2017 to account for the period since the last review (which covered evaluations finished in 2006 and earlier). Strategies included searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV assessment study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV assessments, and getting in touch with leading scientists to ask about forthcoming evaluations. Both released and unpublished reports were included in the search, which was not restricted to the English language and was global in scope.</p>
