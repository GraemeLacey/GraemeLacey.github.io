<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
