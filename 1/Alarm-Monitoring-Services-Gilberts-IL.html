The infrared energy released by an object is referred to as its heat signature. In general, the hotter a things is, the more radiation it emits. A thermal camera includes a heat sensing unit that can detecting tiny distinctions in temperature level.

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much broader area and for that reason provides fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by method of an example. Presume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
