<p>The downside to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, indicating that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and might even set off incorrect alarms. False alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the cops if they happen frequently enough. Another possible disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool need to be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually balanced out by the truth that there are no installation expenses.</p>

On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entrances with removable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensing units and other components can easily be set up at various residential or commercial properties later, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new components too.
