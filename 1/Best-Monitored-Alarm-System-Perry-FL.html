Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first concern you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The response depends upon a number of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you plan to keep and for how long you plan to keep recorded video footage. The video is going to eat up storage area rapidly if there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution.
