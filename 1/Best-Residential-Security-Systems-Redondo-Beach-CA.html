Storage capability: For video recorders, the first concern you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The response hinges on a couple of elements: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you mean to keep and how long you prepare to keep taped video footage. If there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the footage is going to consume storage space quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video once you reach the system's capability, but if you're not mindful, the system may overwrite archived video footage that you still need.</p>
