DIY installation with self-monitoring: Some brand names we recommend, like Ring, Residence, and Nest, offer both professional and self-monitoring.

<p>Frontpoint's outdoor cameras are the most inexpensive in terms of both equipment cost and monthly monitoring costs. They use infrared night vision, have adjustable settings, and live stream to the Frontpoint app. To get the most out of the camera, place it where it's most noticeable. Its wireless installation gives you a great deal of flexibility. If the camera is battery powered you can position it basically anywhere without any wires, charging the battery and removing when it runs low, which is generally triggered through its app. Clearly the advantage is that these can be put anywhere extremely quickly, however the downside is that if it's simple for you to remove the camera to change the battery, it'll probably be easy for burglars to remove it too.</p>
<p>The House Smart Security Set, our previous runner-up, is still a solid choice for some people. House has updated that variation with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which provides a much better range for sensing units. Both the original House system and the House Iota are compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, however the Iota is the only model we checked that also works with HomeKit. We've come across a couple of technical issues while long-lasting testing the Residence Iota, and so will continue to check and upgrade appropriately. We no longer advise it.</p>

I am extremely pleased with this product! The cameras were better than expected and I enjoy the convenience of having the ability to inspect it from my phone while I'm not home.</p>
<p>We enjoy that the Argus 2 features a color night vision option, but the white and black variation can in fact be clearer and offer you higher-quality video footage. This isn't actually a big deal considering the Argus 2's price and all its other features-- however for the record, stick with white and black.
