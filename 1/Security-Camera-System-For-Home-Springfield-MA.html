<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also great metal construction.
