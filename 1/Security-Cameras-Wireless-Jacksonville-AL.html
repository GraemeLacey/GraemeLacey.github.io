<p>The Hive View provides great 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation activated too quickly, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
