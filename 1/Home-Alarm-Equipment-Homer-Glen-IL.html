<p>B.

The scientists looked for CCTV examinations published in between 2007 and 2017 to represent the duration given that the last evaluation (which covered examinations finished in 2006 and earlier). Techniques consisted of searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV examination study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV evaluations, and calling leading scientists to ask about forthcoming examinations.
