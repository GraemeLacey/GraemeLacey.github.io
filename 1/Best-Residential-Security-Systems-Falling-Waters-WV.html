We've been testing Ring Alarm quite a bit lately, and we really like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a packaged security package that provides basic intrusion protection with super-low month-to-month monitoring costs. Or ... no monitoring costs at all if you choose the complimentary self-monitor" alternative.</p>
<p>Both of these cameras are geared up with 180 degrees, 1080p lenses with night vision capability, allowing you to have a clear view of a broad area. The included window mount allows you to use an unit safely inside while still being able to see out. The mount attaches to any glass pane and can be eliminated without harming it.

<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not especially innovative, so we're actually recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will likewise like Nest's contract-free plan option. Sure, you get a lower cost if you go with a three-year agreement, but given that Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining contract if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So choose what will be the much better offer for you. If you know you'll sit tight for a minimum of 3 years, go with the agreement and enjoy those cost savings. But if you might upgrade to a new office with various security needs, contract-free is your best bet.</p>
