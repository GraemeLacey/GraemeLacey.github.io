Some small-business owners will likewise like Nest's contract-free plan option. Sure, you get a lower cost if you go with a three-year agreement, but given that Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining contract if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So choose what will be the much better offer for you. If you know you'll sit tight for a minimum of 3 years, go with the agreement and enjoy those cost savings. But if you might upgrade to a new office with various security needs, contract-free is your best bet.</p>
