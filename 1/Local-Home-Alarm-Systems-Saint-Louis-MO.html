<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Must be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
