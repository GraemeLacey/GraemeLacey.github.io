Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send images of a particular area of interest and are either monitored from another location by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the specified area (La Vigne et al. 2011).

<p>When looking at a typical camera image, you would be hard-pressed to inform the distinction between 1080p and 4K resolution.

However, while 4K resolution offers some advantages, it also brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are very large and take up a lot of recording storage area.
