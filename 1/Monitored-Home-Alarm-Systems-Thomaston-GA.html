Outdoor cameras need to be weather condition resistant and in many cases, totally water resistant. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance rating are the most long lasting. Bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor options because their design allows for minimum glare. In terms of detection, it is much better to have a camera equipped with infrared detection instead of motion detection. This will offer more precise and less frequent informs because oftentimes the motion detection is triggered by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by.</p>
