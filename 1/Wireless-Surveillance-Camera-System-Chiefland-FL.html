Instead, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies every time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
