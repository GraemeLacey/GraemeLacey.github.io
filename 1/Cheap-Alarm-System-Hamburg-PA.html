<p>The Ring Stick Up Camera is available in wired and battery variations, which can be utilized indoors and outdoors. However neither can tape continuously, and they both need the Ring Protect plan to catch recordings. Likewise, the wired version typically left spaces of approximately 7 seconds in between 1-minute recordings, while the battery version left about a minute in between 30-second clips. Both likewise do not have individual detection and geofencing, which other cameras utilize to reduce false informs.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
