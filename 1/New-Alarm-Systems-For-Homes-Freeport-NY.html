If you're on a budget, you can just about get by with the live motion alerts and livestreaming (no membership needed). The Nest IQ is a seriously remarkable piece of technology. For starters, it looks stunning: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily reminiscent of the AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey). It's far from the ghastly metal CCTV box that you may call to mind when you think of a home security camera.</p>
<p>We like the 10-piece Alarm Security Set since it includes all the essentials (base station, keypad, motion sensor) plus a few additional entry sensors. Ring advises this plan for homes with up to two bed rooms and around 2,000 square feet.

It is geared up with a PIR (Passive Infrared) Motion Sensor, so whenever there's some motion found, it can send you a push notice in your phone so you can respond to it instantly. Moreover, the motion sensing unit here is far more innovative than the ones provided by adobe Starter Package. Given that it is a PIR motion sensing unit, it just gets triggered when it captures motion from something giving off infrared energy, i.e., animals and individuals. Furthermore, it doesn't get triggered by small objects.
