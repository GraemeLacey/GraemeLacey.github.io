<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the very same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much larger area and therefore provides fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by way of an example. Assume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image throughout a far bigger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
<p>When mounting cameras inside your house isn't an alternative, you might want to check out hidden cameras, which are cameras that are discreet and small, in some cases fitted into everyday things such as clocks, smoke detectors, and magnets.

Lastly, if you just wish to see what your staff members depend on when you aren't close by, a hidden camera linked to a CCTV camera system may be the very best choice.</p>
