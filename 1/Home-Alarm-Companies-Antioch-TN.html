This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, but not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for additional electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR.

Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

These cameras record everybody similarly: the public going about their daily activities, and bad guys who likely shield or mix themselves in to avoid being recorded or found.
