'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Huge brother? The Corporates? Or harassing neighbour? Who fixes a limit in between public interest and harassment? At the moment, nobody! The camera might legally do what a peeping tom could refrain from doing. They might peer within windows with the complete protection of the law on their side. If a person was standing seeing outside a window it could be a criminal offense, yet the same person could place a surveillance camera then remotely see an individual within the personal privacy of their home. Most importantly, it is not against the penal code.</p>
<p>Do-it-yourself home security companies aren't like the ADTs and Vivints of the world.

<p>Do you own your alarm equipment? Another reason to read your existing alarm contract thoroughly. ADT for example uses totally free" home security systems when you sign up for their multiyear alarm monitoring strategy. Clearly nothing is complimentary. In this case the alarm company owns the main equipment such as control board, keypad, motion sensor. Anything included extra you would own however if you do not renew their high priced strategy they'll remove their" equipment leaving you without any working alarm. Simply another tricky method to keep extremely profitable accounts.</p>
