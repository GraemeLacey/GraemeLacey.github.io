<p>Cross-zoning is a method that does not require a new keypad. Using several sensing units to monitor activity in one location, software application analyses input from all the sources. For example, if a motion detector journeys in one location, the signal is tape-recorded and the central-station monitor alerts the client. A 2nd alarm signal-- received in a nearby zone within a short time-- is the verification the central-station monitor requires to ask for a dispatch immediately. This builds in increased protection and a stop working safe should a door blow open or a bird rattle an outside window.</p>
