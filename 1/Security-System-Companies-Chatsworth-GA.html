On the other hand, a professional monitoring company will call cops if a property owner can't confirm a false alarm. , if authorities are gotten in touch with for an incorrect alarm, house owners may need to pay a fine for dispatching cops unnecessarily.

<p>Video and image feeds have shown vital for surveillance - however there's space for more performance by using audio.

A lot of clever cameras can be configured to do things like this, but few make things as easy as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is supposed to make our lives easier and Hive's community lives up to that. It's all the function without any frustration.</p>

Property owners choosing a system should look for a trustworthy, reputable company.

Trusted companies tend to have better equipment and client service also.</p>
