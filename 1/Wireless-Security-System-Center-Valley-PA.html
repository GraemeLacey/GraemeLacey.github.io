<p>The genuine factor cameras are typically released is to minimize much pettier criminal offenses. However it has not even been demonstrated that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have been thoroughly deployed in public places, sociologists studying the problem have found that they have not reduced criminal activity. "When the criminal offense and offence figures were adjusted to take account of the general down trend in criminal activities and offenses," criminologists found in one research study, "reductions were noted in certain categories but there was no evidence to suggest that the cameras had actually decreased criminal activity in general in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Office also discovered that cameras did not cut criminal offense or the fear of crime (as had a 2002 research study, also for the British government).</p>
