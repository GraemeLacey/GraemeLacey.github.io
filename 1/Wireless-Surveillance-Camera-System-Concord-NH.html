<p>CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a great security camera and an incredible worth. It gets an Exceptional ranking for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 14 days of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to save footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid membership plans for additional cloud storage. But the company does provide a Complete Motion Capture service that continuously records for as long as motion is detected. Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>For clever home features, we suggest the ADT Pulse plan.
