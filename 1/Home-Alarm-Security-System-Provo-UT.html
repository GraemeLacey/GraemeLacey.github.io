<h3>Cheap Security Cameras Provo UT 84604</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never matches the manufacturer's statistics given that this originates from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the greatest perpetrator for short battery life by far. We agree with you about Blink's remarkable battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, however its recording capability is a bit restricted to suggest as a top pick.</p>

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
