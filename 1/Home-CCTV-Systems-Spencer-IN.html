<p>So, while alarm might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security package, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the community ought to carry a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to improved public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer thefts across a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. However, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute substantially to cops ability to nab burglars makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by police and entire communities (all taxpayers subsidize police response to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a pricey and inefficient  approach to robbery reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>

The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still be able to see things clearly.</p>
