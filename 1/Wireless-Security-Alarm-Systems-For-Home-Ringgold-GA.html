<p>so state you have a camera that someone can see it they would shoot it if they had a weapon so I advise to have cameras integrated in to a house that will be pertected by cameras.

<p>IP security cameras capture analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection.

The system can be established to communicate through network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
