<p>Unlike wired security systems that go through your phone lines and can need more comprehensive installation, wireless systems can be installed in a matter of minutes as a fast and pain-free  Do It Yourself project. Convenience is the significant factor individuals switch to wireless," states Du, and it's difficult to refute a 10-minute setup when the wired choice requires professional installation of wires underneath your house. On the other hand, an alarm that is professionally monitored streamlines this procedure. Minutes after an alarm is triggered, a monitoring expert checks in with you. The monitoring experts will dispatch authorities on your behalf if there is a real emergency.</p>
<p>For smart home functions, we advise the ADT Pulse package. It delivers complete IFTTT (If This Then That) technology to let you remotely arm and deactivate your system, turn lights and other electronic devices on and off, and control the thermostat so you never have to come home to a chilly house. ADT also works with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa so you can manage your security system with your voice. 10,000 careful residents with smartphones is much better security than one security individual seeing 10,000 people on CCTV.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
