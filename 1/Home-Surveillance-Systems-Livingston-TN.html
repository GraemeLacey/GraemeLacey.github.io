<p>Establishing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or home is the responsibility of the whole neighborhood. Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first concern you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a couple of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you intend to keep and how long you plan to keep documented video footage. The footage is going to eat up storage space quickly if there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution.
