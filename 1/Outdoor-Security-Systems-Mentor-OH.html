<h3>Home Security Surveillance Cameras in Ohio</h3>

If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be split. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily chosen words) makes pre-shared crucial WPA practically uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based on the last IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
