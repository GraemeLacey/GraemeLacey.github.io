<p>Pelco uses video surveillance cameras and video management services for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping hotels, others, and centers. Some people may state that we should not have surveillance cameras in public locations. They claim that they get into personal privacy. The argument here, however, is why be out in public if you desire privacy? Surveillance cameras are indicated to keep you and other property safe, not to stalk you.

Definitely not perfect-- but the representative apologized and delivered her replacement control panel over night.</p>
