<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
