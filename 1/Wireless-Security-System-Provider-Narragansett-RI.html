Vivint's regular monthly monitoring service plans aren't too pricey, however its equipment costs a quite penny. Prepare yourself to spend several hundred dollars for just your starter package.</p>

Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
