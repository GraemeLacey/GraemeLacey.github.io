False alarms are known to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the authorities if they occur often enough. Another possible disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool need to be changed or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is typically offset by the fact that there are no installation costs.</p>
