<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
