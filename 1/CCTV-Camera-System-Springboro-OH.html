<p>Blue by ADT security systems begin around $200 for equipment. You can choose from a predetermined equipment plan or curate your own setup to match your security needs.

<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
