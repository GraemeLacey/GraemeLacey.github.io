<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as clients understand that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
