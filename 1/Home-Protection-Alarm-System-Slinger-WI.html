Definitely not ideal-- however the associate asked forgiveness and shipped her replacement control board over night.</p>

<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not especially innovative, so we're really advising the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan alternative. Sure, you get a lower cost if you choose a three-year contract, but given that Nest needs you to pay 100% of your staying agreement if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So pick what will be the much better offer for you. Go with the agreement and reap those savings if you understand you'll remain put for at least 3 years. But if you might upgrade to a new office with various security requirements, contract-free is your best option.</p>
