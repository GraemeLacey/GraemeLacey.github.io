<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests possible wrongdoers are less most likely to commit crime if they think they are being seen or have a greater threat of being nabbed. This is also known as the logical choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational crime avoidance strategy, which argues that opportunities to anger can be lowered by changing a range of systems such as increasing the threat of an offender being nabbed, increasing the effort to devote the criminal offense, reducing rewards from crime commission, and reducing justifications that give rise to criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This suggests that the offender needs to understand the included surveillance for it to attain its desired result.</p>
<p>This is the best-scoring smart alarm we tested.
