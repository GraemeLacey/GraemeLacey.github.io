<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later on developed to address the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be split. Utilizing a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly chosen words) makes pre-shared key WPA practically uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
