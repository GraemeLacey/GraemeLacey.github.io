The innovation gradually developed into the extremely advanced yet cost effective systems available today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to tape video and watch it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>

However, bear in mind that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they react at all.

Rules such as these are developed to limit the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on false alarms. Lots of municipalities will fine you for too many incorrect alarms.</p>

Centralizing security into a single user interface provides extra details that may never have been possible in the past, such as alert of a worker, by name and identification number, going into the structure. A picture of that employee exists on screen for verification (validating it's not a stolen ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, guaranteeing no tailgating occurs.</p>
