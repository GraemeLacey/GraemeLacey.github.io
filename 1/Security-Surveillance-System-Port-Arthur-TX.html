<p>Though the Arlo Ultra (see below) technically has all the same smarts and more detailed 4K resolution, the Arlo Pro 3 still won our T3 Awards 2020 award for Best Smart Security , due to the fact that its image quality is still outstanding, and it's slightly much better value - though its price is still its achilles' heel. Still, what you get for the money is all the normal Arlo traits in regards to the solid build quality, superb camera video footage, tons of smart features and a refined app.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
