You can buy this camera for about $35, which contends quite well with Wyze and YI, but its primary strength is Alexa integration. MONITORING. The procedure by which an alarm company receives signals from an alarm and communicates an alarm dispatch request to the town for the function of summoning police reaction to the alarm site.</p>

Nevertheless, remember that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

Although consumers can purchase and install their own security system, an expertly installed alarm system outperforms a diy system any day of the week.
