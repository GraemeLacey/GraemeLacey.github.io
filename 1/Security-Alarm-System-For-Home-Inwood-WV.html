<p>Honeywell's Do It Yourself security system depends on a device called the Camera Base Station. It's an Amazon Echo-like gadget with a camera on top. It serves as the brains of the system, getting in touch with sensors and third party-devices through Z-Wave and managing them utilizing the app or voice control. Another area where Arlo stands out is client service.
