Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking enables the electrical existing to flow throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
