<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
