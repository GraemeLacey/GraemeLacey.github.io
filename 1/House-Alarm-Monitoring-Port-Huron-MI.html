<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic.
