<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ).

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies every time you stroll by.

Here's a look at Vivint security cameras for outdoor and indoor surveillance. Registered for service for my Simon XTi and was active with their service an hour later. The company that installed my alarm failed so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company. These individuals are $18 a month less expensive and stayed in business three decades so I'm comfortable giving them a try.
