<p>If you are interested in a 4K camera system, you ideally will have an extremely high-speed Internet connection and a robust home network, ideally an enterprise-grade network. As discussed above, the 4K camera images are very large, and that is a great deal of information to boss around the home's network and optionally, to an offsite cloud recording service (more on that below). Rely on your HTA Licensed technology specialist for guidance here, as they will be able to identify if a 4K camera system will operate in your situation. Some of the better camera system brand names have controls to change some of the recording parameters in order for slower network connections to still work reliably. Remember that 1080p resolution typically has adequate detail to provide essential video details while maintaining network bandwidth and hard drive storage.</p>
<p>When looking at a typical camera image, you would be hard-pressed to tell the difference in between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the capability to resolve detail after the reality, which indicates that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are very large and take up a great deal of tape-recording storage area. So much, in fact, that they require about 4 times the hard disk area of 1080p to tape-record the very same length of video footage. Be prepared to spend more cash if extended video storage is necessary.</p>

You'll also pay more for pro installation through ADT than you would through Vivint, specifically for cameras. And to be honest, we're not awfully impressed by ADT's cameras in the very first location. What you're spending for is mostly that huge name in blue.</p>
