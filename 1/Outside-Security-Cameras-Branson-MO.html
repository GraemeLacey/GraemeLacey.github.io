And if you require another way to reduce your security costs, SimpliSafe lets you turn professional monitoring on and off as you need it. So if, state, you only wish to have your business monitored when you're away for an exposition, you can do that with Simplisafe.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
